# 🎨 Hirst Dot Painting Generator

A Python program that creates beautiful, colorful dot paintings inspired by Damien Hirst's famous spot paintings using turtle graphics. Each run generates a unique piece of digital art with randomly positioned dots in vibrant colors.

## ✨ Features

- **Randomized Art Generation**: Creates unique dot patterns every time you run it
- **Curated Color Palette**: Uses a carefully selected set of vibrant colors inspired by Hirst's work
- **Turtle Graphics**: Built with Python's turtle module for smooth, artistic rendering
- **Customizable Grid**: Easy to modify dot size, spacing, and canvas dimensions
- **No External Dependencies**: Uses only Python's built-in libraries

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- No additional packages required (uses built-in libraries)

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vichode/hirstpainting.git
cd hirstpainting
```

### Run the Program
```bash
python main.py
```

## 📋 Requirements

This project uses only Python's built-in libraries:
- `turtle` - For graphics rendering
- `random` - For random color selection and positioning
- Standard Python libraries (no pip installs needed!)

## 🎯 Usage

### Basic Usage
Simply run the main script:
```bash
python main.py
```

The program will:
1. Initialize a turtle graphics window
2. Set up the canvas with optimal settings
3. Generate a grid of colorful dots
4. Display the final artwork

### Code Structure
```python
# The program includes:
- Color palette definition with 20+ vibrant RGB colors
- Turtle setup with optimized speed settings
- Grid-based dot placement algorithm
- Random color selection for each dot
```

## 🎨 About the Inspiration

This project is inspired by **Damien Hirst's** famous spot paintings, which feature:
- Perfectly circular dots arranged in grid patterns
- Vibrant, contrasting colors
- Mathematical precision combined with random color placement
- A celebration of color and systematic art creation

Hirst's spot paintings explore themes of life, death, and the systematic nature of existence through the lens of pharmaceutical and scientific imagery.

## 🛠️ Customization

You can easily customize the artwork by modifying:

- **Dot size**: Change the circle radius in the drawing function
- **Grid spacing**: Adjust the distance between dots
- **Color palette**: Add or remove colors from the `colour_set` list
- **Canvas size**: Modify the turtle screen dimensions
- **Number of dots**: Change the grid dimensions

## 🤝 Contributing

Feel free to contribute to this project! Some ideas for improvements:
- Add different dot patterns (hexagonal, triangular grids)
- Implement different color schemes or themes
- Add command-line arguments for customization
- Create animation effects
- Export artwork to image files
